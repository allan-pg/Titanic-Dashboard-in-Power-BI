## Introduction
Titanic Dataset can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file">Kaggle</a>  
It has 1309 rows and 10 columns  

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- Data Modelling
  
## Data Cleaning
- Most of the data had no issues
- I dropped columns which i did not intend to use in my dashboard
  ***Null Values***
- Two rows had null values from embarked column in the titanic dataset
- I dropped the rows since that could not have any impact on our Analysis

# Findings
1. Passengers on board were 1307
   - Male Passengers were 843 and were the most
   - 464 Passengers were Female
2. Total Fare spent by passengers was $43,400
3. Average fare was approximately $33

5. Less than half of our passengers on Board survived
   - In our business class most the passengers survived compared to other flight class
   - In the economy most passengers did not survive
